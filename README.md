## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Hi, welcome to my README for the website performance optimization project.

###Part 1: How to run pizza.html

Download the repository to your computer. Launch the pizzas.html file in your browser. Enjoy!

###Part 2: How did I optimize the project

The key aspects of optimzation focused on rewriting elements of the following functions.

1. changePizzaSizes() -
  The original code embedded dx, newwidth, and document.getElementsByClassName(".randomPizzaContainer") within a for loop       
  I moved them outside of the loop as they had fixed values.

2. updatePositions() -
  Similarly to changePizzaSizes() the original code embedded document.querySelectorAll('.mover') and the phase states in a large for loop
  when document.querySelectorAll('.mover') was fixed and there only 5 phase states.
  I moved them outside the original loop.

3. document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function()
  I lowered the number of pizzas originally generated by calculating the number to load based on the browser screen height, there was no need to load 200 as the original code specified.
